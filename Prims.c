/*We maintain the input given by the user in an adjacency list.

We also maintain a heap to store the the inputs according to weight.

Initially the elements in the heap are defined with parents as node 0 and weights as INT_MAX. 

First of all we remove vertex 0 and after removing it we replace the weights of the edges which are connected to 0 with their 
correct values (overwriting INT_MAX) by looking in adjacency list and we rearrange the heap according to the weights.

So, obviously, among the vertices which are connected to 0, the vertex that has the least weight will come to the top. 

This process is continued in the way such that while removing the vertex on the top, 
we look at all the vertices that are connected to the vertex being removed. 

If the weights in the corresponding heap elements of the vertices that are connected to the vertex being removed are already 
less than the weights of the edges connecting the vertex that is being removed and the vertices that are connected to it, 
we retain those heap element as they are, or we replace the existing weight with lower weight and  we change the parent to the vertex being removed.

While removing an element from the top, MST is formed in such a way that an edge is formed b/w the vertex and parent in the heap element*/
